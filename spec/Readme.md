1. Install `parse server` **globally** (`$ npm i -g parse-server`) or **link it** (`$ npm link parse-server`).

    > **Important:** do not install package `parse-server` locally as it may also get installed on the Back4app server when `package.json` is uploaded to cloud code.

2. Optionally create a file called `.env` to provide your environmental variables.
3. Start server: `$ npm start`.
4. Test: `$ npm test`.
