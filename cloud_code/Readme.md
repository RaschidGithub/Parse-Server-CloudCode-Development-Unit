# Cloud code for Parse Server #
This folder contains the source files and `.js` files to be executed by the [Parse Server](https://docs.parseplatform.org/cloudcode/guide/) instance ([Node.js](https://nodejs.org) based).

Modify sources in `src/` folder using typescript. To build the project run `npm run build`, you'll find output files in `build/` folder.

If you're running the server locally, you must restart it in order for cloud code modifications to take effect.
